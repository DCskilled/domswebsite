  <h3>3 of My Favorite Hobbies</h3>
  <p>The first of my favorite hobbies is to play on my videogame console, which is the Playstation 4. Usually on the weekends I would have already finished all of the homework given to me. From there I would just spend hours playing videogames with some breaks here and there. In the past I do remember afterschool I would go to a friends house just to play on their console because that person would always have the latest and the greatest of games that I didn't have. These days though, videogames have changed my life a bit, for example, I now know how to drive a motorized vehicle, but with a few troubles.</p>



  <p>My second favorite hobby is to just finish all of assignments given to me very early. The reason why this is a favorite hobby is because I know that procrastinating is a bad habit, and so I always finish assignments very early usually. It's the same thing with projects. Peers usually just wait until the last minute just to complete an assignment they have just started. Overall, I'm just a dedicated person on finishing tasks and assignments.</p>


  <p>My third favorite hobby is driving. The reason why a hobby of mine is driving is because it's pretty fun once you get the hang of it. When I was younger, I sometimes took the wheel of the car and steered it for a bit. All of that driving from the past is still attached to me to this day, and now I do know how to drive, even in manual, on my own. Aside from that, I do occasionally have some mistakes here and there, but I do fix them quickly while understanding what I did wrong. </p>
